CONGRATULATIONS! You have your own PyPi mirror infrastructure ready to go!

You should execute the following command for downloading all packages from PyPi:

    bin/pypimirror -I -c -v etc/pypi/pypimirror.cfg

NOTE: It will take a very long time, so I recommend you to go out for shopping 
with your girlfriend, take a coffee, take beers with your friends, plant a tree, 
because when you will be back the download process will be still in progress.
