=====================

The PyPi mirror installer is a source-installation kit that installs a PyPi mirror and all its dependencies. 

Feedback/bugs to: blutgens@gmail.com


Installation Instructions
=========================
The installer will install required python eggs from Pypi. 

PLEASE NOTE: You have the option to run the installation as root or a normal user.

First of all, edit buildout.cfg and modify the following parameters:

 * 'mirror-base' at 'repository' section. This is the directory where all packages will be downloaded. Example:
    mirror-base = /var/www/pypi

 * 'mirror-url' at 'mirror-config'. That URL will be the URL for access to your PyPi mirror. 
Example:
    url = http://pypi.python.org

Once you have installed all required dependencies, you can continue with the installation process. So you execute the following command:
    >>python2.6 bootstrap.py

You should have the buildout environment ready to go. Now, you must execute the buildout installation:
    >> bin/buildout

At the end, you should have the 'bin/pypimirror' binary. Now it's time to start downloading packages from PyPi executing the following command:
    >> bin/pypimirror -I -c -v etc/pypi/pypimirror.cfg

Dependencies
============
The following packages are necessary to run buildout and install the PyPi mirror.
1) setuptools
2) gcc
3) GNU make
4) libpcre3-dev
5) libssl-dev


Post-installation instructions
==============================
Now, we have our PyPi mirror ready to go. We must to run the following command:

    >> $HOME/bin/pypimirror -I -c -v $HOME/etc/pypi/pypimirror.cfg

This command will start downloading all packages from PyPi. When finished an index.html file will be generated containing an index with all downloaded packages.

You'll need to configure a webserver to point at the mirror-base directory, I'll leave that as an excercise for you, a simple apache vhost should do it.

Mirror update
=============
In order to update your mirror simply run bin/pypymirror -U etc/pypimirror.cfg works great as a nightly cronjob =) On a redhat box just drop a simple shell script in /etc/cron.hourly
